### **Background:**

Web apps are a powerful medium to communicate the operations of satellite
missions, and to visualize data from these missions. This challenge invites
you to build interactive 3D web tools that present Earth science missions and
associated data visualizations.

Available code libraries for interactive 3D web-apps are general purpose, and
published NASA data sets were not specifically formatted for the free 3D code
libraries. Modern web browsers can present 3D graphics via WebGL. Free open
source code libraries and free 3D models enable the development of interactive
space mission visualizations. Free web page hosting services enable citizen
scientists to deploy their web apps.

**Your challenge is to develop interactive 3D tools that display trajectories, spacecraft, instrumentation, Earth coverage, and data visualizations! **Research previous and ongoing Earth science missions and available data, and develop a tool that explains the mission or visualizes the data collected. Design your tool to engage the general public, especially teachers and students!

### **Considerations: **

The Web-based Space Mission Visualization Tutorial presentation, identified in
the Resources section, provides links to free 3D WebGL code libraries, a code
library for satellite trajectories, tutorials for converting trajectory data
for display in a web app, and demonstrations of interactive 3D web apps.

Several NASA projects and previous Space Apps Challenge products are available
on an open source code repository. The code repository offers free web page
hosting; so, projects can provide their source code and host a web page with
the embedded web app within the same repository.

Source code and models for interactive 3D web apps must be free for reuse,
well commented and documented, and demonstrated via a working web app embedded
in web page. Code and models ought to be written so that they can be adapted
and reused by citizen scientists interested in designing their own space
missions.

### **Resource Descriptions:**

_Resources and instructions for this particular challenge are lengthy, and
they are thus included here instead of only as links in the Resources menu on
the right._

NASA provides several 3D web resources for technical information, tutorials,
demonstrations, spacecraft models, and links to code libraries:  

1) NASA Technical Report Server (NTRS) – a document repository with a wealth
of information about Earth Science missions. With respect to this challenge,
the presentation “Web-based Space Mission Visualization” (WSMV) identifies
free JavaScript code libraries and provides links to demonstrations and
tutorials:
