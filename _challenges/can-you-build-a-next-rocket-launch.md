### Background
In the emerging era of privatized spaceflight, another space-bound rocket seems to launch every week. Nations around the world have launched rockets carrying satellites and space probes within the past few years. Private companies are now doing launches as well.

Your challenge is to collect flight schedules and projected launch dates to assemble an app/website/online tool with all the latest rocket launch information.

#### Potential Considerations

* What factors go into a decision to launch?
* What are the most common causes of scheduling changes in launches?
* Where are the world’s major spaceports?
* Where are good surrounding sites to view each rocket launch?
* Which company or government does the rocket belong to? What about the payload?
* Can the launch be viewed live online? If so, what’s the URL?
* Include as much useful information as you can!
