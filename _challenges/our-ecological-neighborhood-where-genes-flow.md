### **Background:**

When people move from one location to another, we may choose to travel light
and not carry any belongings, but we carry with us assets that are just as
personal and significant – our genes. The same is true for other species that
migrate away from their native populations into new areas and new communities.
Their movement and subsequent incorporation into new populations leads to the
transfer of genes, and thus, traits, into new populations.

This migration of genes, or “gene flow,” is influenced by a variety of
factors, including the physiology, mobility, and behaviors of the individuals,
and also by their surrounding landscapes and environments. The interplay of
these factors leads to unique patterns of gene flow and local adaptation for
different species in the same environment and vice versa. Understanding these
patterns of flow is important not only to advance the knowledge of ecology and
evolution, but also to guide the management of threatened and endangered
species.

Your challenge is to overlay population genetics data pertaining to a species
of your choice on a map of a region of your choice. Compare the distribution
of different genes, alleles, and/or traits with landscape features, climate
conditions, and human activities in the region to identify potential barriers
or facilitators of gene flow!

_This challenge addresses the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
adopted by the United Nations General Assembly to engage all countries and all
stakeholders in a collaborative partnership. The SDGs aim to build a better
future for all people by achieving sustainable development in three dimensions
– economic, social, and environmental – in the spirit of strengthened global
solidarity:_

  * _Goal 6.6: By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.  
_

  * _Goal 11.4: Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage.  
_

  * _Goal 14.2: By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.  
_

  * _Goal 15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements.  
_

  * _Goal 15.4: By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development.  
_

  * _Goal 15.5: Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.  
_

  * _Goal 15.9: By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, developmental processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts._

### **Considerations:**

  * Consider selecting an endangered or threatened species in your region of choice to identify potential conservation actions and ideas!  

  * How would you identify the most significant drivers of local adaptation in the region of your choice?  

  * What conservation measures (if any) would you recommend based on your results?  

  * Consider creative and interactive means to share your results and recommendations!
