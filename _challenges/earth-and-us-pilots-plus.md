### **Background:**

Have you ever gazed out the window of a flying airplane and wondered what
you’re flying over– geography, points of interest, plants and animal habitats?
Have you wondered how these features have changed over time?

**Your challenge is to build a tool that will allow pilots and passengers to identify geographic, natural, and cultural locations of interest along their flight path. **

You can take the challenge a step further and provide tool users the options
to learn more about each location or point of interest including: history,
significance, change over time, and features that can be identified from the
sky!
